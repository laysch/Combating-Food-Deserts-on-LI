# CSC 325: Island Eats

There are a significant number of food deserts concentrated in low-income neighborhoods on Long Island. These areas lack easy access to affordable, healthy food options like fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Residents in food deserts often have to rely on convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, which typically offer limited selections of fresh produce and prioritize processed foods. This limited access to healthy options has a significant impact on overall health, contributing to diet-related problems like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 

Island Eats aims to create a comprehensive food access and community support platform designed to address this critical issue. This platform will combine features for locating fresh produce, organizing community support and providing information on free food resources. The goal is to offer an easy-to-use, multifaceted tool that helps residents access nutritious food, participate in community initiatives and stay informed about local resources. 

By addressing food deserts and increasing access to healthy food options, the project has the potential to create a lasting positive impact on Long Island.
